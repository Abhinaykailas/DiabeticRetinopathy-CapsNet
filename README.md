Abstractâ€”Diabetic Retinopathy is an eye complication
stemming from diabetes. It is a consequence of any damage to the
blood vessels located behind the eye, especially in the retina.
Blurriness and dark areas of vision are the major and earliest
symptoms. Blindness can occur if left unchecked and untreated,
while mild cases can be treated with appropriate diabetes
management. Diabetic retinopathy is a main cause of blindness in
mature age. It is a complication of diabetes mellitus affecting the
blood vessels in the retina. DR can progress from mild to severe,
and if not treated, this leads to severe blindness. The current gold
standard for DR diagnosis is a dilated eye exam by an
ophthalmologist. This exam has time constraints and price
constraints, and it is not always available in rural or underserved
areas. This research aims to demonstrate a capsule neural
network for classifying stages of diabetic retinopathy by adapting
the dynamic routing process through capsule pruning. The
proposed model will be trained on a dataset comprising fundus
images (images of eyes) to classify the presence and severity of
blindness and its stages. This Proposed model is compared Pre-
trained CNN with VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, and Xception.
Our proposed model had better results with an accuracy
obtained from training is 99% and a accuracy obtained from
validation is 98%. Diabetic Retinopathy is a rare ailment in
terms of occurrence. Due to the low demand for tests and check-
ups, the cost of diagnosis is generally high and out of reach for
rural and remote societies.
